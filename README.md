# MECHTRON-SFWRENG-3KO4-Project
This project involves applying the Principles of Software Development. The process of developing software is applied to the creation of a system that imitates a pacemaker. 
The SIMULINK-based system is responsilbe for detecting and sending modified electrical pulses to a circuit mimicking a heart and its chambers. UART serial communication
is established between the SIMULINK component and a Python user interface.
